# Validation testing

## Homepage (recipes.html) (inclused the homepage after the user login)

* The first time I ran the html5 validation test for recipes.html, the document came out with 1 error (the same one multiple times) and 1 warning. The error is the following: div and h4 elements are not allowed to be child of ul element and the warning is a suggestion to consider to use h2 or h6 elements for identifying headings. The error and warning were not fixed because they break the layout of the website and can not fulfil the developer's idea. I checked with these errors the site and they do not damage the functionality of the application, so I decided to leave everything unchangeable.

## Login.html

* The first time I ran the html5 validation test for login.html, the document came out with 2 error and a warning: the h4 element is not allowed as a child ul element in this context, max-length is not allowed inside an input element and the warning is a suggestion to consider using h2 or h6 elements to identify headings. I fixed the error inside the input element and I  found the other error and warning irrelevant, as they do not affect the functionality of the form, and I did not change them.
