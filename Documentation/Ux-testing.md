## End

* The website application trought materialize use a material design style [view here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design) if you want more detail. There is not too much variety on the site, all the pages look similar so as not to lose the continuity of the website style and remain constant. This was my choice and in my opinion if we are talking about a cookbook website, with the use of material design come very friendly, happy simple and so easy.
