2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the website settings and navigate without confusion.
3. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to find the registration area and sign in quickly and easily.

#### Returning visitors goals

1. As a returning visitor, I want to see more recipes, and I expect that delicious new food recipes will  make the site even more interesting and attractive.

#### Frequent visitors golas

1. As a regular visitor, I want the website to always be smooth, intuitive and not lurid, with new images that increase the user's interest not to leave, but to check out all the recipes
